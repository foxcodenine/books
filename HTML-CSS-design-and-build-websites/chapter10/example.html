        <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
        <p>A <i>potager</i> is a Freanch term for an ornamental vegetable
           or kitchen garden. Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and
           herbs are planted with the vegetable to enhance the garden's 
           beauty. The goal is to make function of providing food 
           aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <h2>What to Plant</h2>
        <p>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for 
            their color and form. Many are trained to grow upward. A 
            well-designed potager can provide food, cut flowers and 
            herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers 
            can disguise their function of providing for a home in a 
            wide array of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage 
            garden to the formality of a knot garden.</p>
