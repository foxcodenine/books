        <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
        <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials form 
           Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important
           components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature,
           dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide),nutrients and pH. These 
           elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.
