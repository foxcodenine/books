           briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog 
           traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
        
        <h2>Breed History</h2>

            <span id="italic">
                The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, 
                has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The 
                breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and 
                to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of 
                hearing.

                Briards were used in the First World War almost to 
                the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards 
                is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson 
                and Lafayette all owned briards.
