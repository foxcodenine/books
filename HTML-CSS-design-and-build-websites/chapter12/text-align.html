    <p>The <b>red owl</b> (<i>Tyto soumagnei</i>) is an <a href="#">owl</a> in the 
        <a href="#">barn</a> owl <a href="#">family</a> Tytonidae. 
        It is also known as the <b>Madagascar red owl, Madagascar grass-owl</b> 
        and <b>Soumange's owl</b>. It is a rare resident of 
        <a href="#">Madagascar</a> that was virtually unknown from its discovery 
        in 1876 to its rediscovery by researchers from the <a href="#">World Wide 
        Fund for Nature</a> in 1993. It is currently listed as <a href="#">
        vulnerable</a> because of <a href="#">habitat</a> loss, but recent 
        studies have determined it may have a wider range than believed, though 
        further research in distribution and ecology is required. It has possibly 
        been overlooked because of its close resemblance to the closely related 
        <a href="#">barn owl</a>.
