           briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog 
           traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
        
        <h2>Breed History</h2>

        <p>           
           The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, 
           has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The 
           breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and 
           to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of 
           hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to 
           the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards 
           is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson 
           and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
