        <p id="intro">This article is about an additional full moon that appears in a subdivision of a year. For other uses, see

        <p id="first_p">A blue moon is an additional full moon that appears in a subdivision of a year: either the third of four full moons 
            in a season, or a second full moon in a month of the common calendar.
        </p>
        <p id="second_p">The phrase in modern usage has nothing to do with the actual color of the Moon, although a visually 
            blue Moon (the Moon appearing with a bluish tinge) may occur under certain atmospheric conditions â€“ for instance, 
            if volcanic eruptions or fires release particles in the atmosphere of just the right size to preferentially 
            scatter red light.<sup>[1]</sup>
