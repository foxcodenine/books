        <h1>Gray Fox - Urocyon cinereoargenteus</h1>

        <h2 id="subtit1">Characteristics</h2>
        <p id="para1">The gray fox is a peppery gray on top, reddish-brown on its 
            sides, chest and the back of its head. Its legs and feet are 
            also a reddish color. It has a long bushy tail with a black 
            stripe on top. The gray fox has pointed ears, a pointed muzzle 
            and long hooked claws.
        </p>

        <h2 id="subtit2">Range</h2>
        <p id="para2">The gray fox can be found from southern Canada to northern 
            Columbia and Venezuela. It is not found in some mountainous 
            parts of the Northwest United States and in the Great Plains.
        </p>

        <h2 id="subtit3">Habitat</h2>
        <p id="para3">The gray fox lives in a wide variety of habitats but prefers 
            areas with lots of brush or woods.
        </p>

        <h2 id="subtit4">Diet</h2>
        <p id="para4">The gray fox is a solitary hunter and eats a wide-variety of 
            foods. A large part of its diet is made up of small mammals 
            like mice, voles and eastern cottontail rabbits. It also eats 
            birds; insects; and plants like corn, apples, nuts, berries 
            and grass. In the summer and autumn, grasshoppers and crickets 
            are an important part of its diet.
        </p>

        <h2 id="subtit5">Life Cycle</h2>
        <p id="para5">Mating season is between January and April. About 53 days 
            after mating, the female gives birth to one to seven pups. 
            The male helps feed the pups. They are weaned when they are 
            about three months old and are able to hunt on their own 
            when they are four months old. The pups leave their mother 
            in the autumn. The same males and females usually mate 
            together every year.
        </p>

        <h2 id="subtit6">Behavior</h2>
        <p id="para6">The gray fox can climb and will occasionally forage for food 
            or rest in a tree. It makes its den in rocky crevices, caves, 
            hollow logs and trees. It will sometimes enlarge a woodchuck 
            burrow and use it as a den. Dens are usually used only during 
            the mating season and when raising young.
